# React Bootstrap Typeahead
React-based typeahead component that uses Bootstrap as a base for styles and behaviors and supports both single- and multi-selection. The UI and behaviors are inspired by Twitter's [typeahead.js](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js). Try the [live examples](http://ericgio.github.io/react-bootstrap-typeahead/).
